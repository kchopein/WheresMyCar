# WheresMyCar

Just a little exercise to play around with Event Sourcing and MongoDB.

# The Goal

The goal of the applicaion is to help people remember where they parked their cars. Well, that's not technically true: the goal is to build something using Event Sourcing.
I'm trying to use a DDD/Microservices approach with fine grained services (one per aggregate) to see if it makes sense or is just an extremist's point of view...


# The building bricks
I'm using ASP.NET Core + MongoDB for now.
